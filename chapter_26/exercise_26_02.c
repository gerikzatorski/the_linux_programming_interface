/*********************************************************************
Suppose that we have three processes related as grandparent, parent,
and child, and that the grandparent doesnâ€™t immediately perform a
wait() after the parent exits, so that the parent becomes a zombie.
When do you expect the grandchild to be adopted by init (so that
getppid() in the grandchild returns 1): after the parent terminates or
after the grandparent does a wait()? Write a program to verify your
answer.

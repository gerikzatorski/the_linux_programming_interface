# Chapter 6

## Exercise 6-1

mbuf is not explicitly initialized and therefore part of the unitialized data segment. Space is not allocated until run time by the program loader.

## Exercise 6-2

Run program to see what happens to variable declared within returned function.

```sh
./exercise_06_02
```

## Exercise 6-3

Program modifies environment variable 'TEST' with custom function and prints complete environment intermittently.

```sh
./exercise_06_03
```
